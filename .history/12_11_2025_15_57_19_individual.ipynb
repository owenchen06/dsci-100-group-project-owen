    "The method I will use to address the question is knn-regression. This method will help predict the total hours played using Age as the quantitative predictor variable, since the other variables are categorical. Thus I plan to split the data into multiple subsets and perform knn-regression on each individual subset. Since the variable experience has 5 categories, subscribe has 2 categories and gender has 7 categories, there would be 70 potential subsets of data (5 x 2 x 7). Then, k-nn regression will be performed with Age as the predictor and played_hours as the response variable, since categorical variables cannot be predictors for k-nn regression. \n",
    "This method is appropriate because it can capture nonlinear relationships between age and total playtime. Furthermore, due to the mix of categorical and quantitative data, splitting the data into subsets is most appropriate so that knn-regression can still be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only assumptions needed to apply this method is that players with similar ages within each category subset would also be expected to have similar playtime. Otherwise, no other assumptions are nessacary.\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation is that the method would not work as well with variable combinations that have small sample sizes, due to lack of neighbors to make reliable predictions. Furthermore, splitting data into subsets reduces the overall sample size, which further reduces the reliability of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying the model, the plan is to perform cross validation within each subset, which would help select the opitmal k value and model for each variable combination. However, this is only possible with variable combinations that have sufficient sample size. Prior to the cross validation, the data will be split 90% into training and 10% into testing. The larger split into training is to ensure that there is enough data for model fitting "
